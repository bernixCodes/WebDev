# My Web Development Journey with Angela Yu

Welcome to the repository for my projects completed during Angela Yu's Web Development course! Each project is crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and resides on a separate branch. Below are the projects I've completed so far:

1. **Project 1**: [Simon Game]
2. **Project 2**: [Portfolio Site]
3. **Project 3**: [Dice Challenge]
4. **Project 3**: [Drum Kit]


## Projects Overview

Each project branch contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files required to run the project. Feel free to explore the branches to delve into the code and see how each project was crafted.



## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-dev-projects.git
   ```

2. Switch to the branch corresponding to the project you wish to explore:
   ```bash
   git checkout project-1
   ```

3. Open the project files in your preferred code editor to view and modify the code.
